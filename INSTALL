Installation of plasTeX is very simple.  It installs just like any other
Python package.  Simply run the following command.

	python setup.py install

Python 2.7+ is required, as is setuptools; a virtualenv is
recommended. The tested platforms are OS X and Linux; other platforms
may or may not work with the odds being greatest on other Unix-like
systems.


To generate images for destinations like HTML, you will also need to have
a LaTeX distribution installed, and either ghostscript or, preferably,
either dvi2bitmap (http://dvi2bitmap.sourceforge.net/) or
dvipng (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/dvipng/).
